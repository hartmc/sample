sample
======
In this code sample, I've included the Board package from chess software that I worked on over the past few years. You'll see this is a robust object oriented representation of a chess board, pieces and moves.  

A good place to start might be the ChessRules class where taking an object oriented approach made the code much easier to write and understand.

Thank you so much for taking time to consider my application!
